## SysAPAE

The system is divided into two modules, so that each person responsible for his area can control the relevant user information.

### Pedagogical

The pedagogical module is responsible for managing the information of the period in which the user uses APAE's pedagogical services.

#### Goal

This module manages and automates the information generated by the pedagogical coordinator and educators while the user with disabilities is using the pedagogical service.

#### Functionalities

* Class Control:

The pedagogical coordination can register a class by associating an educator, edit it by changing its name or the professional. It is also allowed to observe the class and view the history of classes and the frequency of students.

The educator can register, view, print, attend, complete class, and define user performance in that specific class. Based on these data, the educator can see how much that particular user has progressed from one class to another and can look for ways to exercise that activity more intensely.

* Educator Control:

* Pedagogical Screening Control: 

The coordination can manage all users' logical screening, performing registration, research, editing and printing of the screening, navigating between two tabs that are: unrealized screening and performed screening, after the social screening performed, because, only then will it be available to the pedagogical.

* IEP Control: 

Every user who has a pedagogical screening will have a PEI - Individualized Educational Planning attached to it. With this, the educator can edit, view and print this data at any time he / she notes a development in the attributes mentioned.

### Social Assistance

The social assistance module developed in this paper is responsible for APAE user follow-up data after the user joins the association.

#### Goal

This module will manage the socio-demographic form, the visits made to the resident user by the social assistance team and the referrals of any service provided by the association.

#### Functionalities

* Employee registration: 

The health and social assistance coordinators can register social workers and collaborators in the collaborator registration area. Social workers can also update user data, but employees can only view user data.

 * Action Record: 
 
 Coordinators can also view the action records of social workers and coordinators, made for pertinent user data. This record is formed by the date of the action, the user of the system that performed the action, the type of action, whether it is editing or registration of any given data, what type of data was changed and the identification of the object that had its data changed.
